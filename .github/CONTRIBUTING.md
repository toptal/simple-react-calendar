We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community.

## Reporting issues and asking questions

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/toptal/simple-react-calendar/issues) to make sure your issue hasnâ€™t already been reported.

**We use the issue tracker to keep track of bugs and improvements** to Simple React Calendar itself, its examples, and the documentation. We encourage you to open issues to discuss improvements, architecture, internal implementation, etc. If a topic has been discussed before, we will ask you to join the previous discussion.

For support or usage questions, please search and ask on [StackOverflow with a `simple-react-calendar` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/simple-react-calendar). We ask you to do this because StackOverflow has a much better job at keeping popular questions visible. Unfortunately good answers get lost and outdated on GitHub.

**If you already asked at StackOverflow and still got no answers, post an issue with the question link, so we can either answer it or evolve into a bug/feature request.**
